        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: In this class I hope to be able to add my own animations and videos into a highly customized website by the end of the term. I also would like to build a concrete base/understanding for how html and css works so that I can continuously build my knowledge in the future without having to back track endlessly. As far as a special project or technology that I would like to see by the end of the term, I would like to learn how to make buttons and learn how to make them look appealing.</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are your initial thoughts on flex box vs grid? Are you drawn to one more than the other? What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project one I am planning on doing a special on abandond places in Oregon. Some will have a haunted history attached to them and others won't, but all of them are ones that you can go and view - at your own risk for one or two. I'm planning on showing images of the locations/structures and then a short synopsis on the history and lore surrounding the locations/structures. To maintain consistency I plan on using the same typefaces, similar type hierarchy, similar if not the same color palette, and the same filter/appearance of my photos. I aim to make the pages of my website flow smoothly from one to the next. I want to be able to lead the viewers eye in a predictable manner. But each page will be unique in picture placement, text placement, and if I can get it to work, gifs. For my website I want it to have an underlying spooky/eerie theme, but still have that classic modern feel that Oregon tries to portray. To implement this in my type I want to use a classic sans-serif, but one that tends to have taller slim characters to be a bit spookier. When it comes to my imagery I'm leaning into making them ghostly and adding noise into the photos with photoshop. Color palette is where I am still feeling uncertain. I'm thinking a light off-white, mossy green, and then maybe a burnt red or orange? I still have to play with it because I don't want to lose the impression that this is Oregon specific nor do I want to make this website seem like it is strictly Halloween related. This is something I am going to have to play with, but I think I would like to include a pale yellow and possibly a deep purple. </p>
