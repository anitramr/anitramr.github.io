        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: In this class I hope to be able to add my own animations and videos into a highly customized website by the end of the term. I also would like to build a concrete base/understanding for how html and css works so that I can continuously build my knowledge in the future without having to back track endlessly. As far as a special project or technology that I would like to see by the end of the term, I would like to learn how to make buttons and learn how to make them look appealing.</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are your initial thoughts on flex box vs grid? Are you drawn to one more than the other? What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project one I am planning on doing a special on abandond places in Oregon. Some will have a haunted history attached to them and others won't, but all of them are ones that you can go and view - at your own risk for one or two. I'm planning on showing images of the locations/structures and then a short synopsis on the history and lore surrounding the locations/structures. To maintain consistency I plan on using the same typefaces, similar type hierarchy, similar if not the same color palette, and the same filter/appearance of my photos. I aim to make the pages of my website flow smoothly from one to the next. I want to be able to lead the viewers eye in a predictable manner. But each page will be unique in picture placement, text placement, and if I can get it to work, gifs. For my website I want it to have an underlying spooky/eerie theme, but still have that classic modern feel that Oregon tries to portray. To implement this in my type I want to use a classic sans-serif, but one that tends to have taller slim characters to be a bit spookier. When it comes to my imagery I'm leaning into making them ghostly and adding noise into the photos with photoshop. Color palette is where I am still feeling uncertain. I'm thinking a light off-white, mossy green, and then maybe a burnt red or orange? I still have to play with it because I don't want to lose the impression that this is Oregon specific nor do I want to make this website seem like it is strictly Halloween related. This is something I am going to have to play with, but I think I would like to include a pale yellow and possibly a deep purple. </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it. Please also share a site inspiration for the week. I'm loving seeing your inspirations!</p>
        <p>Response: I think the person who will love my project 1 website will be someone who listens to murder and cult podcasts. Someone that likes learning about history and potential hauntings. Someone who likes to learn about places that have been left behind years ago; places that you can go to be alone. Someone that does not fear that kind of solidarity and rather enjoys it. Not in a spooky kind of way, but in a way such as all they wanted to do as a pre-teen was sit in the library and read book after book after book. Someone that is just curious, but does not necessarily want to act on any impulses. I see someone like this visiting my website for a short bit of information and then maybe coming back to it every once and a while if they forget a tidbit of the history of these abandoned places. </p>

        <p>Prompt: Compare the site you are redesigning to 2 similar sites. Consider their content hierarchy, attention to customer needs, ease of use. Write about your findings. You may use a SWOT analysis template(link). Response to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsqoG0X5rcM">Umoju Miller</a> talk.</p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What did you choose the business/cause that you chose? 
          Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? 
          Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? what bothers you abut them? 
          How will you improve things in your own design.</p>
        <p>Response: For project 2 I have decided to redo the Broder website. It's modern and it functions, but it does not
          advertise the business very well nor does it convey the charming atmosphere of the cafe/restaurant. I think my
          redesign could be better because I am familiar with the restaurant having been a regular customer for the past few years
           and I am also familiar with scandinavian culture which the cafe/restaurant specializes in (I am from a scandinavian background)
          . I really want to focus on the landing/home page and advertising the delicious food they have to offer. The current 
          homepage is their logo and a blue duotoned photo of their food. Their colours are the vibrant blue and yellow of the 
          Swedish flag, but the use of the colours is not super smart and I feel as though a lot of improvement could be made there. 
          In my redesign I want to focus on showcasing the food and the environment of the restaurant. I would also like to highlight
          the foreign/Swedish aspect of the cafe/restaurant since that is their main gig. Other similar websites showcase their food
          and menu options a lot more and show more pictures of the insides of their restaurants which I think are both very smart 
          decisions. But all of the sites have really boring navigation systems and sometimes strange groupings/heirarchies to their
          foods. I plan on having a more intuitive navigation system, one that is still plain enough that it stands out to people
          who might not be too tech savy. I want this website to be easy to navigate and understand. </p>

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Read this article on mobile first design and share your thoughts on mobile first vs desktop first.</p>
        <p>Response: Personally I find it very challenging to design for mobile first, but I believe I know why. I've always been better at solving problems, such as multiple choice on tests,
          by first ruling out which answers are not correct. My brain functions better taking away things rather than adding them and I think this way of thinking affects my coding. I think it 
          would be much easier for me to build the desktop version first because then I would have more or less all of my elements. And since my interpretation of mobile is that it is a simplified 
          website where you mostly take things away and rearrange them, it would be easier for me to do mobile second. This isn't based on practicality -- as the article mentions, a lot of websites 
          are more or less mobile only/heavy now. But this is just based on how I think and how I work. In project two I am trying to build my website mobile first, but I am finding it so much 
          harder to do this way. It would definitly be different if it was a mobile only website thus only having one form, but it is not.
