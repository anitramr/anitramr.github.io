        <p>On the night of December 10, 1999, the Philippine island of Luzon, home to the capital, Manila, 
            and some 40 million people, abruptly lost power, sparking fears that a long-rumored military 
            coup d’état was underway. Malls full of Christmas shoppers plunged into darkness. Holiday parties 
            ground to a halt. President Joseph Estrada, meeting with senators at the time, endured a tense ten 
            minutes before a generator restored the lights, while the public remained in the dark until the cause 
            of the crisis was announced, and dealt with, the next day. Disgruntled generals had not engineered the 
            blackout. It was wrought by jellyfish. Some 50 dump trucks’ worth had been sucked into the cooling pipes 
            of a coal-fired power plant, causing a cascading power failure. “Here we are at the dawn of a new millennium, 
            in the age of cyberspace,” fumed an editorial in the Philippine Star, “and we are at the mercy of jellyfish.” </p>
            
            <p class="aparagraphb">A decade later, the predicament seems only to have worsened. All around the world, jellyfish are behaving 
            badly—reproducing in astonishing numbers and congregating where they’ve supposedly never been seen before. 
            Jellyfish have halted seafloor diamond mining off the coast of Namibia by gumming up sediment-removal systems. 
            Jellies scarf so much food in the Caspian Sea they’re contributing to the commercial extinction of beluga 
            sturgeon—the source of fine caviar. In 2007, mauve stinger jellyfish stung and asphyxiated more than 100,000 
            farmed salmon off the coast of Ireland as aquaculturists on a boat watched in horror. The jelly swarm reportedly 
            was 35 feet deep and covered ten square miles.</p>

            <p class="aparagraphc">Nightmarish accounts of “Jellyfish Gone Wild,” as a 2008 National Science Foundation 
                report called the phenomenon, stretch from the fjords of Norway to the resorts of Thailand. By clogging 
                cooling equipment, jellies have shut down nuclear power plants in several countries; they partially disabled 
                the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan four years ago. In 2005, jellies struck the Philippines again, this 
                time incapacitating 127 police officers who had waded chest-deep in seawater during a counterterrorism exercise, 
                apparently oblivious to the more imminent threat. (Dozens were hospitalized.) This past fall, a ten-ton fishing 
                trawler off the coast of Japan capsized and sank while hauling in a netful of 450-pound Nomura’s jellies.</p>

        <p>The sensation of getting stung ranges from a twinge to tingling to savage agony. Victims include Hudson River 
            triathletes, Ironmen in Australia and kite surfers in Costa Rica. In summertime so many jellies mob the waters 
            of the Mediterranean Sea that it can appear to be blistering, and many bathers’ bodies don’t look much different: 
            in 2006, the Spanish Red Cross treated 19,000 stung swimmers along the Costa Brava. Contact with the deadliest type, 
            a box jellyfish native to northern Australian waters, can stop a person’s heart in three minutes. Jellyfish kill 
            between 20 and 40 people a year in the Philippines alone.</p>
        
        <p class="bparagraphb">The news media have tried out various names for this new plague: “the jellyfish typhoon,” “the rise of slime,” 
            “the spineless menace.” Nobody knows exactly what’s behind it, but there’s a queasy sense among scientists that 
            jellyfish just might be avengers from the deep, repaying all the insults we’ve heaped on the world’s oceans.</p>

        <div class="bparagraphsb">
            <p>“Jellyfish” is a decidedly unscientific term—the creatures are not fish and are more rubbery than jamlike—but 
                scientists use it all the same (though one I spoke with prefers his own coinage, “gelata”). The word “jellyfish” 
                lumps together two groups of creatures that look similar but are unrelated. The largest group includes the 
                bell-shaped beings that most people envision when they think of jellyfish: the so-called “true jellies” and 
                their kin. The other group consists of comb jellies—ovoid, ghostly creatures that swim by beating their hairlike 
                cilia and attack their prey with gluey appendages instead of stinging tentacles. (Many other gelatinous animals 
                are often referred to as jellyfish, including the Portuguese man-of-war, a colony of stinging animals known as a 
                siphonophore.) All told, there are some 1,500 jellyfish species: blue blubbers, bushy bottoms, fire jellies, 
                jimbles. Cannonballs, sea walnuts. Pink meanies, a.k.a. stinging cauliflowers. Hair jellies, a.k.a. snotties. 
                Purple people eaters.</p>
            <p class="bparagraphbb">The bell-shaped jellies—distantly related to corals and anemones—launched their lifestyle 
                long, long ago. Exquisite jellyfish fossils found recently in Utah display reproductive organs, muscle structure 
                and intact tentacles; the jelly fossils, the oldest discovered, date back more than 500 million years, when Utah 
                was a shallow sea. By contrast, fish evolved only about 370 million years ago.</p>
