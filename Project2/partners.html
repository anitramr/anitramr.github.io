        <h2>Nordic Northwest</h2>
        <p class="nwp1">Founded in 1986 to support the Nordic language programs at Portland State University, 
            Nordic Northwest has expanded on its original mission over the past three decades to become the home 
            for all things Nordic in Oregon and Southwest Washington. Anchored by a Midsummer festival in June and 
            a Christmas market in December, Nordic Northwest's roster of programming includes concerts, exhibits,
             family programming, special events, film screenings, lectures, classes, dances, performances and celebrations 
             throughout the entire year that focus on the cultures of Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden.</p>
        <p class="nwp2">We introduce new generations to stories of the Nordic past, celebrate the values of contemporary 
            Nordic societies and highlight new developments and innovations from Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and 
            Sweden. We are an inclusive community, welcoming to those of Nordic and non-Nordic descent alike and seek 
            to uphold the ideals of the contemporary Nordic countries, including sustainability, egalitarianism and a 
            deep connection to nature. Nordia House is a home for anyone interested in the Nordic countries and we look 
            forward to helping you discover more about the lands of the far north. </p>

        <h2>Water Avenue Coffee</h2>
        <p class="wp1">The spark of inspiration that appeared in 2009 has grown into one of Portland’s most well-respected 
            coffee companies. In September of 2015, Water Avenue Coffee started roasting in a freshly remodeled warehouse 
            on three new Proaster coffee roasters and expanded it's training lab and wholesale offices.</p>
        <p class="wp2">“It’s the culmination for all of our passions for coffee and our expertise of being coffee professionals,” 
            Matt said. “It’s allowed us to really do something from our hearts. We want to be known as a unique and genuine 
            micro-roaster that started in Portland, in the heart of the most competitive market, that people appreciate for the 
            right reasons.”</p>
        <p class="wp3">By bringing together great coffees and great people, Water Avenue Coffee stands out for its incredible 
            products and unsurpassed customer service, even in a city where great coffee is often just around the corner. We 
            thrive on building long term relationships with our customers and wholesale accounts. </p>
